                <strong><small> A little about me</small></strong>
                <p>I lived my whole life in California where the weather was always hot but had the nice west coast beaches at my leisure. Sometimes its hard to appeciate what you have when you feel
                    like life is running 100 miles per hour. That feeling was true when I graduated high school , not knowing what I would like to do for the rest of my life or even know who I truly am. 
                    Those questions really keeps somebody up at night but the beauty of it which is a saying that I came up with which is " The best way to discover something is to get lost along the way"

                        Let's start where my life really began to change, the life of college one may say. We have this belief on how college should play out from what we see in movies, the crazy 
                        parties, building your "own" schedule, being able to have "freedom", the never ending stress of work. Fortunately for me, I decided to try and get myself into sports again,
                        recovering from almost tearing my patellar tendons in each knee, it really makes you realize you eating habits because I became the most unhealthiest in my life.
                        Meeting great friends, having mentors and having something to really want to push me like being a decathlete, it helped in my studies and get my life together

                        <h1>The never ending surprises of life</h1>
                        <p>
                            Just when you think you have life figured out, it always finds ways to give you throw in a bit of flair into your life. I was involved in an unfortuante accident totalling
                            my first car I have ever owned. I was lucky enought to walk away from the car crash unscathed but not having the money to replace the car I had, it made me realize that this
                            can be comsidered rock bottom for me. I started to fail in my studies, unable to really find my passion that once lit my heart ablaze and losing interest in track. The only thing 
                            that plagued my mind was make money to survive in this world. Sometimes there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

                        <strong><small> Funny what happens when you take life seriously</small></strong>
                        <p>I received that call that was a life changer, the phone rang and as I picked up the phone, it was my sis-in-law. The thoughts came to mind, " Why is she calling me"
                            The conversation was about to change my life, do something risky and think what my life could be. She did not like my living situation and advocated me to do something. 
                            After the phone call, I put in my two weeks, finished my interviews, packed my things and left to colorado. Since I have arrived, I was hired at a bank which I did not fully believe 
                            in myself since it was dealing with money, little did I know how much I could really impact those around me including being a successful teller including our sales. 
                            After some expereince, I decided to take a risk and apply to Schwab which has been the most eye opening expereince.... Even while my training to be prepped for my role, 
                            I have made strides and slowly being infectious across the company. Even as I am making this, I am a top candidate to present an idea that can revolutionalize 
                            the way culture is perceived in the company while giving more power to career build for those accepted into the company. Even with everything going on
                            my focus became to learn coding, what can I do with a set of skills that I have never tapped into, the challenge... it thrills me.

                            <p>
                                Once I saw what tech can do for me, I realized what I can do for it. My biggest goal in life is to be free. Being free is no worries about life, financials, do work where ever I want
                                Thats where I see my life with being a Web Developer, be able to do free lance work and explore the world. Being able to have that freedom, it will allow me to 
                                live life and experience what the world has to offer. Eventually, I had a moment of realization, where the world is going, the damages done to society because the way the world is ran.
                                Becoming President of the US is where I am headed towards so I can make strong changes and impact the world on a level to serve Earth. First though, lets enjoy life and experience where the future is going
